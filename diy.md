## Sourcing the hardware

At the time of writing, there's no way to supply finish hardware. Not
in any way that scales, at least.

It's a self-assembly job. This will involve ordering a PCB - this part
is easy, at least - then sourcing the parts and soldering/assembling
the complete board. You'll need tools for this. Also be aware that
it's a non-trivial assembly, and some of the soldering is quite fine
detail.
