## Welcome

Hi. Welcome to the "Washing Machine" kata. This is a code kata for
embedded systems developers. Unlike most code katas, this one also has
hardware. As ever, embedded is a little unusual :)

## Where To Start

Everyone should start by checking the tool setup, which also gives
some advice on getting a walking skeleton project set up from a
template.

If you're unfamiliar with TDD and the idea of deliberate practice,
we'd recommend starting with the TDD primer - this gives some guidance
on the overall approach.

If you're a TDD-ist already, you might still get some useful.

And, of course, everyone needs to look at the kata spec to see what
the challenge is!
